### üß∞ Setup Instructions
1. **Import the FreeRTOS Library**
   - Copy the folder named `ArduinoUnoFreertos` into your project directory.
   - This folder contains the FreeRTOS source files required for compilation.
   - Obtain this folder from the college lab files.

2. **Include FreeRTOS in your code**
   ```c
   #include "FreeRTOS.h"
   #include "task.h"
