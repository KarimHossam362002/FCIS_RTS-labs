Got it 👍 — here’s a **simpler, clean version** of your README.
It keeps your original tone and structure, just adds short and clear steps for cloning, extracting, and using Proteus.

# 🧠 Real-Time Systems — Hands-On Labs

This repository contains hands-on lab exercises for the **RTS (Real-Time Systems)** course.
Each lab demonstrates core real-time concepts such as task scheduling, timing, and multitasking using **FreeRTOS** and **Microchip Studio**.

---

## ⚙️ Lab 1 — Two Tasks Blinking (FreeRTOS on Arduino Uno)

### 🧩 Requirements

* Proteus 7.0
* Microchip Studio for implementation
* Arduino Uno Envrimoent

---

## 🪛 How to Use This Repository

### 🔹 Step 1 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KarimHossam362002/RTS-Handson.git
cd RTS-Handson
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2 — Extract Proteus Files

* Find the file named **“Proteus 7 Professional.zip”** in the main folder.
* Right-click → **Extract All...**
* After extracting, open **`BIN/ISIS.EXE`** from the extracted folder to start Proteus.

---

### 🔹 Step 3 — Open Each Lab

Each lab folder (like `Lab1`, `Lab2`, etc.) contains:

* 🖼 **A picture of the hands-on question**
* ⚙️ **A Proteus hardware design** `.DSN` file
* 💻 **Source code** that solves the problem

To run a lab:

1. Open **Proteus** → `File → Open` → choose the `.DNS` file inside the lab folder.
2. Open the code files in **Microchip Studio**.
3. Build and upload (or simulate using Proteus).
